          <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Ana Polleri and I am a Web Developer based out of Los Angeles, California.
          I have an Associates Degree in Business Administration and Management as well as an background as an Executive Assistant. 
          In my position as an Executive Assistant I have interfaced frequently with clients, in addition to vendors and staff. This has instilled multi-dimensional communication skills and an ability to recognize, act upon, and fulfill client wishes and needs in order to ensure their continued, and positive, relationship with the business.
            <br>
            <br>
            I found myself creating websites as a hobby and decided to turn it into my career and join CareerFoundry. I learned the ins-and-outs of being a successful web developer. Not only did I code for 10-15 hours a day with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, but I also learned to utilize full-stack development langauges such as Node.js.
            <br>
            <br>
            When I am not coding you can find me at the beach, hiking or out and about taking pictures. I enjoy photography as well as fashion and design. I believe that all my creative type hobbies and interest help me grow and become a better web developer everyday.
          </p>
